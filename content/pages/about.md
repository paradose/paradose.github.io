I'm Lauren Lok, an aspiring software engineer with a creative mindset. I currently reside in Melbourne but come from the land below the wind aka Sabah, Malaysia. 

Currently, I specialise in Back-end Development. I'm confident in Java and C# and have a good grasp of Object Oriented Principles. However, I'm slowly working on my Front-end skills to work towards being a full-stack developer.

I started this blog website as a way of practicing how I express myself and my learnings- whether that be technical, philosophical or something I've been obsessed with.
