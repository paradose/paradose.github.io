I'm Lauren Lok, an aspiring software engineer based in Melbourne with a creative drive. I was previously interning at Deloitte Digital (2021) as a Back-end Developer on web applications built in Sitecore. Currently, I'm finishing off my Bachelor of Computer Science at Monash University.

I specialise Back-end Development. I'm confident in Java and C# and have a good grasp of Object Oriented Principles. However, I'm building my Front-end and Design skills to work towards being a Full-Stack developer or potentially a UI/UX designer.

I started this website as a way of practicing how I express myself and my learnings- whether that be technical, philosophical or something I've been obsessed with.
