    <p align="center">
        An application that connects users to their favorite movies and shows.</br> This was completed from my university course in application Usability, collaborating with a group of 3 others. In this project, I performed user research, wireframing and contributed to the design of the application.

       My personal pixel art account that I work on in my spare time. Most designs are done on Aseprite with the help of my Wacom Tablet ;) Highly inspired by my passion for pixel-graphic video games. Focus on nature, food and requests from friends.
