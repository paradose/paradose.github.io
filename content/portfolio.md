       Our team's <a href="devpost.com/software/culie">submission</a> for 2021 Unihack that won the award for Best Design. I assisted with the interface design, as well as the front-end of the page built with React.

    <p align="center">
        An application that connects users to their favorite movies and shows.</br> This was completed from my university course in application Usability, collaborating with a group of 3 others. In this project, I performed user research, wireframing and contributed to the design of the application.

    <p align="center">
       An application that generates art prompts to help unleash users' creativity. 
       </br>Inspired by pixel dailies that tweets prompts everyday. I found this helpful when I faced blocks and wanted to scribble something for fun. I also got to be part of an awesome community of artists and meet other creative individuals.
       </br>Inspired, I came up with this app idea and created the UI following a modern minimalistic design. Design made with Figma, app development to be completed in Flutter.

       My personal pixel art account that I work on in my spare time. Most designs are done on Aseprite with the help of my Wacom Tablet ;) Highly inspired by my passion for pixel-graphic video games. Focus on nature, food and requests from friends.
